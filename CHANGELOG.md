# üôè Thank You

A big thanks to these people who helped make this addon better:

* Locke38
* TAB
* Gutz
* `</TYLER>`
* Everyone who helped test different versions of the addon
* And of course, all the friendly folks I encountered out in the wild while testing extensively \<3

**Their help with testing and feedback has been super important in getting the addon to where it is today.**

# ü©π Patches

## 1.11.1
   * Fixed an issue relating to a library used with the AddOn, which for some users would through an error.
      * This isn't the library's fault -- if a user had a different version of the library included (possibly from a different addon), it would cause the error.
      * This is now fixed, and the addon should work as expected.

# ‚ú® Version 1.11.0

This update started as a small change to the information window but turned into a big overhaul of the whole addon. It's a big update, and we're excited to share it with you! The AddOn is now much faster, with less memory usage, and more stable. We've also added new features, fixed bugs, and updated the addon to work buttery-smooth with The War Within expansion üòé

We really appreciate all the feedback and ideas from the community, and we're excited to keep making the addon better. Please keep sharing your thoughts and suggestions, and we'll do our best to include them in future updates.

## **Partial Settings Wipe:**

We've made substantial changes to the general flow of the addon, and we've made some changes to the settings. You **will not** lose messages or nemeses. You **will lose** all of your `General Settings` configurations. Make sure you configure the settings you want immediately after updating.

## **Information Window Improvements:**

   * The info window is now much easier to use and understand.
   * You can see all stats for all classes, with ones that don't apply grayed out.
   * Added Back and Forward buttons to make navigation easier.
   * You can now choose which chat channel to report stats in.
   * We're planning more improvements for future updates.
      * The information window is still a work in progress, and we have more ideas for the future.
      * Your feedback is really important in shaping the addon (and this feature in particular), so **please** share your thoughts, especially about the user interface changes!

## **New Features:**

   * "Rolling Messages": Messages now "roll" through a list, making communication more varied and interesting.
      * You can turn this on or off in the settings menu (General Settings, Core). It's on by default.
      * For events with multiple possible messages, we'll go through the list instead of picking randomly.
      * This helps when there are lots of messages and stops the same message from showing up too often.
   * Added support for delves.
   * Added support for follower dungeons.
   * Added support for normal dungeons.
   * New LFG features: You'll hear a sound and see a message when a tank, healer, and/or DPS applies to your group. These options are toggleable in the settings menu (General Settings, Core, LFG QoL).
      * Toggle for tank, healer, and DPS.
      * Customize the sound for each.
   * The "Pulls" feature has graduated to a full-fledged feature.
      * New channel customization option for announcing pulls.
      * Pulls are **always** tracked, regardless of the settings.

   > All the features you'd expect from Mythic+ dungeons are now available in delves, normal dungeons, and follower dungeons. For the time being, there are no new triggers specifically for these dungeons. We plan to add the triggers, but we were so eager to get this update out that we decided to focus on the features you'd expect from Mythic+ dungeons first.

## **Speed Improvements:**

   * Made big improvements to how fast the addon runs.
   * Greatly reduced how much memory the addon uses, fixing slowdowns that happened over time.
   * All messages are preprocessed and stored in memory, so the addon doesn't have to do as much work. This may seem like a small change, but it can make a big difference in how fast the addon runs.
   * The underlying logic of the AddOn requires far less CPU and memory than before, which means it runs faster and more reliably.
   * Rankings calculations (used in reports) are now calculated both in realtime and on-demand. For anyone who experienced hitches after combat ended, this will help a lot.
   * With the frontloading effort, each event can be processed in a fraction of the time it used to take.

## **Code and Stability Improvements:**

   * Cleaned up the code to make it easier to maintain and improve in the future.
   * Made the addon more stable and reliable overall.
   * Front-loaded the addon, which means it loads faster and uses less memory.
   * Dramatically simplified the overall flow:
      * Prior to this update, the addon had a lot of different parts that were all connected in a complex way.
      * This resulted in many things calling each other, which would sometimes cause the exact same data to be retrieved and/or stored multiple times.
   * Reports now use a new, simplified system which is more reliable.
   * Rankings has been overhauled entirely, and it's now much more reliable and speedy.
   * Event handling has been simplified and improved.
      * Several events could compete with eachother, and this caused problems.
      * A great example would be taking damage -- that event could come from avoidable damage, unavoidable damage, or damage from a debuff.
      * The damage could even have been from oneself, like Burning Rush.
      * All of these events used to compete with eachother, but now will be handled exactly as you'd expect.

## **Bug Fixes:**

   * Fixed problems with handling missing information in various functions to prevent errors.
   * Improved how combat events are processed for more accurate tracking.
   * Fixed memory leaks that were causing the addon to slow down over time.
   * Fixed issues with the "clear" button in the info window.
   * Fixed problems where the addon was still running in the background when disabled.
   * The info window will no longer show up or work when the addon is turned off.
   * Fixed a crash that happened when the player's name wasn't found in the combat log.
   * Improved how the addon handles replacing text in messages, making it more reliable.
   * Fixed several core issues:
      * Damage events no longer block other events from being processed.
      * Avoidable damage is now tracked correctly.
      * Avoidable damage events no longer prevent other events from being processed.
   * Fixed an issue where interrupts weren't being tracked correctly when a player's pet (like a Warlock's demon) did the interrupt.
   * Fixed an issue where the addon was still running in the background when disabled.
   * Fixed issues with instability in the tracking of metrics.
      * Defensives were the major victim of this, but it affected other metrics as well.
      * We've fixed the issue and tested every metric to make sure they're working correctly.
   * Lots more bug fixes!

# üëÄ **Potential Issues:**

   * We've seen inconsistent behavior with reports. After a lot of testing + fixing, we've finally reached the point where we are unable to reproduce the issue. If you're still having problems, please let us know!
   * LFG QoL is brand spanking new, and we've not seen any issues yet. If you do, please let us know!
   * "Rolling Messages" is also brand spanking new! We've tested this more times than we care to admit, and we've not seen any issues yet. If you do, please let us know!
   * Delves and Follower Dungeons may have some flaws. We tested extensively in varying conditions, and think we have it all covered, but we're still working on it. If you experience issues, please let us know!
