# 🎯 Key Changes

## 📢 Summary

**1.8.x**: Things are spicing up with M+ leaver detection and low performer detection! 

**1.7.x**: Hazardous Pull reporting? Neglected Heals reporting? Yes please! Oh, and more replacement tags, revamped reports config, new off-heals report, etc!

**1.6.x**: Lots of new replacement tags and condition subjects. Added a `Flag Friends as Nemeses` option -- if anyone in your group is on your friends list, they'll be flagged as a Nemesis.

## 🩹 Patches

- **1.8.6**: One more fix for name logic which has been throwing errors.
- **1.8.5**: Fix for name logic which was sometimes causing issues due to a race condition.
- **1.8.4**: More bug fixes and groundwork for next version.
- **1.8.3**: Bug fixes and groundwork for next version.
- **1.8.2**: Bursting logic for affixes.
- **1.8.1**: Pull announcements were getting a little loud during boss fights (first boss on NL for example). They will no longer occur during boss fights. This will likely be configurable once this feature is out of beta.

## ⭐ Latest Versions

### 1.8.0

- Nemesis prioritization for scenarios where more than one message is retrieved for an event.
- Beta features: hardening and optimization -- they're very close to full release state!
- Enable / disable messages for APIs.
- M+ early leaver storage and sync
   - Leavers will now be logged in a persistent DB.
   - Leavers will be synced between players in-game.
- M+ low performers storage and sync
   - Low performers will now be logged in a persistent DB.
   - Low performers will be synced between players in-game.
   - Low performers are currently defined as:
      - At least 2 spots in the bottom (bottom affixes / DPS (non-DPS exempt) / offheals, most pulls (tank exempt) / deaths / avoidable damage).
         - Deaths are taken fairly lightly, as that can be due to any number of reasons. Deaths are primarily examined base on how much avoidable damage was taken.
      - Within those spots on the bottom, there must be a difference of >= 30% between them and the top for said metric.
- Fix for dungeon keystone level.
- Lots of new stuff behind the scenes, paving the way for some really awesome future features!
