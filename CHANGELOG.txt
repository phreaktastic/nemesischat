# üéØ Key Changes

- New UI with stats and the ability to report as desired.
- New trackers:
   - Crowd control
   - Defensives
   - Dispells
- New replacements, events, conditions, etc.
- Performance tracking which will attempt to rank players within the group based on:
   - DPS (for DPS only)
      - Tracks when a DPS is lower than tank and/or healer DPS
      - Tracks when a DPS is significantly lower / higher than others in the group
   - Affixes
      - Attempts to understand which classes / specs should be exempt 
      - Scoring based on handling affixes (CCing souls counts, for example)
   - Avoidable Damage
   - Crowd Control
   - Deaths
   - Usage of defensive abilities
   - Dispells
   - Interrupts
   - Offheals
   - Butt pulls
   - And more!
- Overperformer and underperformer tracking
   - Ability to store in permanent DB
   - DB synchronization with other players
   - Reporting for when someone joins who was marked as either over/under performing recently
   - Based on scoring of all of the above metrics
   - Smart scoring -- for example, a Resto Druid will not be negatively scored for a lack of **interrupts** (yes, they can disrupt / CC)
