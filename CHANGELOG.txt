# üéØ Key Changes

## üì¢ Summary

**1.5.x**: Group and raid join/leave events have been split for a higher degree of granularity. More replacements added. Group and raid join/leave events will be exempt from the message interval limit, however it will be capped at 3 per trigger (imagine inviting large groups into a raid and firing off join messages for each player ü§¢).

**1.4.x**: Nemesis Chat has shifted its paradigm in a big way! Nemeses are now essentially just a feature; everything within the addon will function with or without Nemeses. This means you can simply define triggered messages for Bystanders and yourself, and the addon will function as expected.

## ü©π Patches

### 1.5.1

- Typo fixes
- Properly updating the version of the addon

## ‚≠ê Latest Versions

### 1.5.0

- Refined `SELF` join events versus inviting a player and forming a group. No configuration updates are necessary.
- Group `JOIN` and `LEAVE` events are now exclusive to non-raid groups.
- Added raid `JOIN` and `LEAVE` events to allow for more granular configuration.
- Group/raid `JOIN` and `LEAVE` events are now exempt from the minimum message interval.
   - There is a hardcoded cap of 3 to guardrail against spam.
- Added the following replacement tags:
   - `[ROLE]`: Your role
   - `[BYSTANDERROLE]`: The/a Bystander's role (on events triggered by a Bystander, that'll be the triggering Bystander, otherwise a random one is chosen)
      - Keep in mind random Bystanders are chosen once so all Bystander replacement tags will refer to a singular Bystander.
   - `[NEMESISROLE]`: The/a Nemesis's role (on events triggered by a Nemesis, that'll be the triggering Nemesis, otherwise a random one is chosen)
      - Keep in mind random Nemeses are chosen once so all Nemesis replacement tags will refer to a singular Nemesis.
      - As always, these are described in the `Reference` tab of the NC Configuration screen.
- Minor updates to information presented in some configuration screens, such as `About`.

### 1.4.0

- Everything will function with/without Nemeses configured / present.
- Messages with `[NEMESIS]` / `BYSTANDER` replacement tags will be treated as conditional messages requiring at least one Nemesis / Bystander present in the group.
   - You may define as many messages as you'd like using these tags, and they'll be used only when the above conditions are met.
- Messages triggered by a Nemesis or Bystander will only fire when a Nemesis / Bystander is present in the group.
   - This hasn't actually changed, however, it's worth noting with the new approach üòä
   - You may define as many messages as you'd like with these triggerers, and they'll be used only when appropriate.
- `PUG Mode` has been removed entirely as it is obsolete. The new approach functions far better, and unlocks far more functionality, without additional configuration / feature toggles.
- üêõ Noteworthy bug fixes:
   - Details API Overall DPS calculations fix (no more 1.4M DPS).
   - Fixed an issue with (re/un)subscribing to/from events. In some rare cases, Nemesis Chat would not function at all due to unsubscribing from crucial events.
   - Improvements to Dungeon and Boss recovery: When reloading UI, data is lost. However, Nemesis Chat attempts to retrieve previously set data when possible. This has been improved and as a result, you should almost never experience lost data outside of relogging. ü§û
   - Reports:
      - Reports will no longer fire in the case of lost data (from relogging, for example).
      - If there is a tie, reports will now list all players in shout outs and call outs. Example, 3 players have `0` avoidable damage taken for a boss, the shout out will include all 3 players.
   - Events:
      - Fixed an issue preventing self-triggered spellcasts and feasts from firing.

# ‚è±Ô∏è Coming Soon

## ‚úÖ Confirmed

- Nemesis configuration within reports:
   - Exclude Nemeses from shout-outs üòà
   - Replacements for Nemeses; Example, your Nemesis would get a shout-out for lowest damage dealt -- instead, you set a message that reads, `Shout out to [NEMESIS], who sat around doing nothing and consequently took 0 avoidable damage. Yaaaay.`

## üí≠ Under Consideration

> **Note:** If you think any of the following features would be beneficial, *please* reach out in Discord and voice your opinion! I am a solo developer, and there is no possible way I can think of all scenarios. Your input would be greatly appreciated üòÅ

- Player context menu -- `Add Nemesis` and `Remove Nemesis`:
   - Major considerations are ensuring this does not break anything else, as hooking into the context menu has a high propensity for this.
   - One prospective downside is NC is not designed for setting a PUG player as a Nemesis and this could potentially lead to abuse.
   - On the flip side, the addon itself could always be abused anyway, and one can only realistically provide guard rails for prevention of abuse.
- UI element for tracking Interrupts and Avoidable Damage.
   - This will need to be non-intrusive, and configurable / disableable.
   - Clicking on one would allow sending (customizable) reports.
- Other potential "leaderboard-esque" UI elements
   - Same as above -- non-intrusive, etc.
- AI configuration screen
   - Granular control over which (praise | taunt) messages to send based on whether it's a Bystander or Nemesis, and based on event.
   - Custom overrides
   - More AI choices (possibly a scale, 1-10, from taunt (1) to praise (10))
