# Version 1.4.x

## Summary üì¢

Nemesis Chat has shifted its paradigm in a big way! Nemeses are now essentially just a feature; everything within the addon will function with or without Nemeses. This means you can simply define triggered messages for Bystanders and yourself, and the addon will function as expected.

## Key Changes üéØ

### Minor Versions

None yet, `1.4.0` is fresh!

### Major Version -- 1.4.0

- Everything will function with/without Nemeses configured / present.
- Messages with `[NEMESIS]` / `BYSTANDER` replacement tags will be treated as conditional messages requiring at least one Nemesis / Bystander present in the group.
   - You may define as many messages as you'd like using these tags, and they'll be used only when the above conditions are met.
- Messages triggered by a Nemesis or Bystander will only fire when a Nemesis / Bystander is present in the group.
   - This hasn't actually changed, however, it's worth noting with the new approach üòä
   - You may define as many messages as you'd like with these triggerers, and they'll be used only when appropriate.
- `PUG Mode` has been removed entirely as it is obsolete. The new approach functions far better, and unlocks far more functionality, without additional configuration / feature toggles.
- üêõ Noteworthy bug fixes:
   - Details API Overall DPS calculations fix (no more 1.4M DPS).
   - Fixed an issue with (re/un)subscribing to/from events. In some rare cases, Nemesis Chat would not function at all due to unsubscribing from crucial events.
   - Improvements to Dungeon and Boss recovery: When reloading UI, data is lost. However, Nemesis Chat attempts to retrieve previously set data when possible. This has been improved and as a result, you should almost never experience lost data outside of relogging. ü§û
   - Reports:
      - Reports will no longer fire in the case of lost data (from relogging, for example).
      - If there is a tie, reports will now list all players in shout outs and call outs. Example, 3 players have `0` avoidable damage taken for a boss, the shout out will include all 3 players.
   - Events:
      - Fixed an issue preventing self-triggered spellcasts and feasts from firing.

## Coming Soon ‚è±Ô∏è

### Confirmed

- Nemesis configuration within reports:
   - Exclude Nemeses from shout-outs üòà
   - Replacements for Nemeses; Example, your Nemesis would get a shout-out for lowest damage dealt -- instead, you set a message that reads, `Shout out to [NEMESIS], who sat around doing nothing and consequently took 0 avoidable damage. Yaaaay.`

### Under Consideration

- Player context menu -- `Add Nemesis` and `Remove Nemesis`:
   - Major considerations are ensuring this does not break anything else, as hooking into the context menu has a high propensity for this.
   - One prospective downside is NC is not designed for setting a PUG player as a Nemesis and this could potentially lead to abuse.
   - On the flip side, the addon itself could always be abused anyway, and one can only realistically provide guard rails for prevention of abuse.
- UI element for tracking Interrupts and Avoidable Damage.
   - This will need to be non-intrusive, and configurable / disableable.
   - Clicking on one would allow sending (customizable) reports.
- Other potential "leaderboard-esque" UI elements
   - Same as above -- non-intrusive, etc.
