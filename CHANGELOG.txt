## ⭐ Latest Versions

### 1.9.0

- New UI with stats and the ability to report as desired.
   - This is a preview of 2.x functionality.
- New trackers:
   - Crowd control
   - Defensives
   - Dispells
- New replacements, events, conditions, etc.
- Performance tracking which will attempt to rank players within the group based on:
   - DPS (for DPS only)
      - Tracks when a DPS is lower than tank and/or healer DPS
      - Tracks when a DPS is significantly lower / higher than others in the group
   - Affixes
      - Attempts to understand which classes / specs should be exempt 
      - Scoring based on handling affixes (CCing souls counts, for example)
   - Avoidable Damage
   - Crowd Control
   - Deaths
   - Usage of defensive abilities
   - Dispells
   - Interrupts
   - Offheals
   - Butt pulls
   - And more!
- Overperformer and underperformer tracking
   - Stored in permanent DB
   - DB synchronization with other players
   - Reporting for when someone joins who was marked as either over/under performing recently
   - Based on scoring of all of the above metrics
   - Smart scoring -- for example, a Resto Druid will not be negatively scored for a lack of **interrupts** (yes, they can disrupt / CC)
- The same process which happens for nemeses and configured messages will now happen for bystanders:
   - All bystanders will be checked for matching conditions
   - The most optimal message will be chosen based on all criteria
   - This allows one to set hyper-specific criteria, and know that if someone ever meets that criteria, the message will be used
- Mountains of fixes and optimizations

### 1.8.0

- Nemesis prioritization for scenarios where more than one message is retrieved for an event.
- Beta features: hardening and optimization -- they're very close to full release state!
- Enable / disable messages for APIs.
- M+ early leaver storage and sync
   - Leavers will now be logged in a persistent DB.
   - Leavers will be synced between players in-game.
- M+ low performers storage and sync
   - Low performers will now be logged in a persistent DB.
   - Low performers will be synced between players in-game.
   - Low performers are currently defined as:
      - At least 2 spots in the bottom (bottom affixes / DPS (non-DPS exempt) / offheals, most pulls (tank exempt) / deaths / avoidable damage).
         - Deaths are taken fairly lightly, as that can be due to any number of reasons. Deaths are primarily examined base on how much avoidable damage was taken.
      - Within those spots on the bottom, there must be a difference of >= 30% between them and the top for said metric.
- Fix for dungeon keystone level.
- Lots of new stuff behind the scenes, paving the way for some really awesome future features!

### 1.7.0

- New `Flag Guildmates as Nemeses` option
- Two new conditions, `is guildmate` and `NOT guildmate`
- More enhancements across the configuration screen
- New Off-Heals reports
- New dungeon completion Deaths report
   - Includes the amount of avoidable damage they took throughout the dungeon
   - If the amount of avoidable damage taken is excessive, the report will also include an amount relative to their life ("*6.25M avoidable damage (10.88x their max health)*") 😈
- Report channel selection in configuration
- Revamped all segments, normalized all data, and exposed a few more replacements in the process
- **(Beta) pull reporting**: This feature will announce seemingly unintentional / hazardous pulls
   - Tanks are not included
   - This is not precise as Blizzard does not expose great ways of doing this
   - It currently only reports in real-time, and as a yell
   - More options to come as this feature matures
- **(Beta) neglected heals reporting**: This feature will announce when (non-healer) players have been at or below 60% health without receiving a (non-self) heal
   - This feature also only reports in real-time, and as a yell
   - Once again, more options to come as this feature matures
- **(Beta) affix tracking and reporting**: This feature contains both announcements and reports:
   - Announce when affix mobs begin casting (if enabled)
   - Announce when affix mobs successfully cast (if enabled)
   - Announce when affix mobs are interrupted **but not incapacitated/dead** (if enabled)
   - Top and bottom affixes handled reporting for boss fights and end of dungeon (if enabled)
