**Current Considerations:**

- Reports:
    - Report the highest avoidable damage taken.
    - Report the least interrupts (or report zero).
    - Report the lowest DPS.
    - Thresholds for all which would support it:
        - Lowest DPS *IF* there is >= 30% disparity from top to bottom.
        - Highest avoidable damage taken *IF* >= _x_ (300k for example).
    - All reports should be available at all times, and should have their own configuration screen.
- PUG Mode:
    - PUG Mode should be a toggle. 
    - When PUG Mode is enabled, subscribe to all events as if a Nemesis is in the group.
